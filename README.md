In many networking systems, Bloom filters are used for highspeed set membership tests. They permit a small fraction
of false positive answers with very good space efficiency.
However, they do not permit deletion of items from the set, and previous attempts to extend “standard” Bloom filters to support deletion all degrade either space or performance.
